[Evangelium]
Continuação ++ do santo Evangelho segundo S. Mateus.
!Mt 24:3-13
At that time, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came~
to Him privately, saying: Tell us, when are these things to happen, and what~
will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the world? And in answer Jesus~
said to them, Take care that no one leads you astray. For many will come in My~
name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. For you shall~
hear of wars and rumors of wars. Take care that you do not be alarmed, for these~
things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against~
nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be pestilences and famines~
and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginnings of~
sorrows. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will put you to death;~
and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. And then many will fall~
away, and will betray one another, and will hate one another. And many false~
prophets will arise, and will lead many astray. And because iniquity will abound,~
the charity of the many will grow cold. But whoever perseveres to the end, he~
shall be saved.

[Offertorium]
!Sl 128:7
We were rescued like a bird from the fowlers’ snare; broken was the snare, and~
we were freed.

[Secreta]
Look with favor, O Lord, upon the prayers and offerings of Your faithful, that~
they may be pleasing to You for the feast of Your saints and may bring us the~
help of Your mercy.

[Communio]
!Lc 12:4
But I say to you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who persecute you.

[Postcommunio]
Be appeased by the prayers of Your Saints, O Lord, and grant, we beseech You,~
that the rites we perform in this lifetime may avail for our eternal salvation.

[Commemoratio Oratio]
! de S. Canuto
Ó Deus, que para glória da vossa Igreja Vos dignastes honrar o B. Rei Canuto com a palma do martírio e o dom de insignes milagres, concedei-nos propício que, assim como ele imitou a Paixão do Senhor, assim também nós, segundo os seus vestígios, mereçamos alcançar os sempiternos gozos.
