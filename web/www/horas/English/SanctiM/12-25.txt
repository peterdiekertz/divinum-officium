[Lectio9]
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Mt 1:1-6
The Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem 
!.
In Isaiah we read: "Who shall declare His generation?" Let us not think that there is any contradiction between the Prophet and the Evangelist, because the Prophet saith that this thing cannot be done, and the Evangelist beginneth by doing it. The one speaketh of the generation of the Divine (Word by the Eternal Father,) the other of the (family in which the) Incarnation (took place.) Matthew beginneth with carnal things, that by learning of men we may go on to learn of God. "The Son of David, the son of Abraham." The reversal of the order in these clauses is a needful change. If Abraham had been put first and David afterwards, Abraham would have had to be taken again, in order to marshal the pedigree properly.

[Responsory11]
R. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
* The same was in the beginning with God.
V. All things were made by him: and without him nothing was made
R. The same was in the beginning with God.
