'Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife'. Above we stated that spouses are called wives; which fact the Book against Helvidius explains more fully. Now, by way of approval the Angel speaks to him during sleep, to sanction the appropriateness of his silence. It is likewise to be noted that Joseph is called the son of David in order that Mary also might be shown to be of the offspring of David.
