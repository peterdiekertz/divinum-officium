[Ant Matutinum]
I will none of thee, prey of death, for I am prevented by another Lover;;1
My right hand and my neck hath He clasped with precious stones, and put pearls beyond price in mine ears;;2
He hath sealed me in my forehead, that I may let in no other lover but Him.;;4
The Lord hath clothed me with a vesture of wrought gold, and adorned me with a necklace of great price;;5
I have sucked honey and milk out of His Mouth, and His Blood is red on my cheeks;;8
The Virgin of Christ * is not shaken by terror nor seduced by favours;;10
V. In thy comeliness and thy beauty.
R. Go forward, fare prosperously, and reign.
Christ hath crowned me with the bright and priceless blossoms of the eternal spring-time;;14
I am wedded to the Lord of Angels, at Whose beauty the sun and the moon do wonder;;44
His Holy body * is already united to me, and his blood is red upon my cheeks;;45
I plight my troth * to Him alone at whose beauty the sun and moon do wonder;;47
Stans a dexteris eius Agnus nive candidior Christus sibi sponsam et Martyrem consecravit;;84
I plight my troth to him alone, and committ myself altogether to Him;;86
V. God shall help her with his strength
R. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved.
Lord hath sent his angel, * and hath delivered me out of the fire I was not burnt;;249;250;251
V. God hath chosen her and fore-chosen her.
R. He hath made her to dwell in His tabernacle.
