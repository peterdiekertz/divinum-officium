[Ant Matutinum]
I am well born * and of a respectable family, as all my relations testify.;;1
And if you are free-born, why do you show yourself a servile person? * Because I am the handmaiden of Christ, therefore I show myself to be a servile person.;;2
The best of my birth is * that I was born the slave of Christ.;;4
I look like a slave * because I am one the slave of Christ.;;5
The holy Agatha said: Dost thou promise me beasts? When they hear Christ's name they grow tame.;;8
If thou put the fire to me, Angels will bring me a saving dew from heaven.;;10
V. In thy comeliness and thy beauty.
R. Go forward, fare prosperously, and reign.
Unless thou make the executioners to handle my body vigorously, my soul will not be able to enter into the Lord's paradise with the palm of martyrdom.;;14
O Lord, Thou hast seen how I have fought, and how I have run in the race; but, because I would not obey the magistrates, they ordered me to be tortured in the breasts.;;15
Because of my chastity they ordered me to be stretched upon the rack; help me, O Lord my God, for they are torturing my breasts.;;44
Agatha went to prison with great joy and exultation, like a guest to a banquet, and recommended her struggle to the Lord in prayer.;;84
Agatha, having gone into prison, * was blessing the Lord Jesus Christ;;86
My mind * has been strengthened, and has been established by Christ.;;95
V. God shall help her with his strength.
R. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved.
When the Blessed Agatha * came into the prison, she stretched forth her hands to God, and said: O Lord, Who hast made me overcome the cruelty of the executioners * May it please Thee that I should attain unto thy mercy.;;249;250;251
V. God hath chosen her and fore-chosen her.
R. He hath made her to dwell in His tabernacle.

[Responsory9]
R. While the blessed Agatha was being grievously tortured in the breasts, she~
said to the judge
* Thou foul, cruel, and bloody tyrant, art thou not ashamed to do this to me,~
having thyself sucked at a mother's breast?
V. I have breasts within, which have been the Lord's from my childhood, and them~
thou canst not mangle.
R. Thou foul, cruel, and bloody tyrant, art thou not ashamed to do this to me,~
having thyself sucked at a mother's breast?
