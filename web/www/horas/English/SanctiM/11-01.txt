The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, * who in His Law do meditate day and night.;;1
The Lord hath set apart for Himself them that are holy, * and when they called, He hath heard them.;;4
Let all them be glad that hope in thee: they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee.;;5
How excellent is thy Name, O Lord, Who hast crowned thy Saints with glory and honour, * and madest them to have dominion over the works of thy hands.;;8
They that work righteousness, * O Lord, even they, shall abide in thy tabernacle, and dwell in thy holy Hill.;;14
This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, * that seek the face of the God of Jacob.;;23
V. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous.
R. And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require truth.;;30
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous, * and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.;;31
O fear the Lord, all ye His Saints, * for there is no want to them that fear Him. Behold, the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry.;;33
O Lord, Thou hast been a shelter for thy Saints, * a strong tower from the enemy. Thou hast given the heritage to those that fear thy Name, and they shall abide in thy tabernacle for ever.;;60
O Lord, God of hosts, blessed are all those who hope in Thee: He will not deprive of good things them that walk in justice: they will praise Thee forever and ever.;;83
Ye that love the Lord, rejoice in the Lord, * and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.;;96
V. Let the righteous rejoice before God.
R. Yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
Give praise to our God, all ye his saints; and you that fear him, little and great. For the Lord our God the Almighty hath reigned. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give glory to him.;;259;254;255
V. The righteous live for evermore.
