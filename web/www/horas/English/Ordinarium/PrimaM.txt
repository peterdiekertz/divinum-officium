v. Now in the sun's new dawning ray,
Lowly of heart, our God we pray
That he from harm may keep us free
In all the deeds this day shall see.
_
May fear of him our tongues restrain,
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:
His favouring care our guardian be,
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.
_
May every heart be pure from sin
And folly find no place therein:
Scant need of food, excess denied,
Wear down in us the body's pride.
_
That when the light of day is gone,
And night in course shall follow on.
We, free from cares the world affords,
May chant the praise that is our Lord's.
_
* All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete.
Amen.
