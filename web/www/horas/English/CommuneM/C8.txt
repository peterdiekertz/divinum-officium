Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 19:1-10
At that time, Jesus entered and was passing through Jericho. And behold there~
was a man named Zacchaeus; and he was a leading publican, and he was rich. And~
he was trying to see Jesus, Who He was, but could not, on account of the crowd,~
because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a~
sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way. And when Jesus came~
to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste~
and come down; for I must stay in your house today.And he made haste and came~
down, and welcomed Him joyfully. And upon seeing it all began to murmur, saying,~
He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.But Zacchaeus stood and~
said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give one-half of my possessions to the poor,~
and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold. Jesus said to~
him, Today salvation has come to this house, since he, too, is a son of Abraham.~
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.
