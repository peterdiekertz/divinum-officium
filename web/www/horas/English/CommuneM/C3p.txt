[LectioE]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:1-7
1 I am the true vine; and my Father is the husbandman. 
2 Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit. 
3 Now you are clean by reason of the word, which I have spoken to you. 
4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me. 
5 I am the vine: you the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.
6 If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into the fire, and he burneth. 
7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you.
