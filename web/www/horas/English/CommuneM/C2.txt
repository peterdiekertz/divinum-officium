!Luke 14:26-33
14:26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
14:27 And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
14:28 For which of you having a mind to build a tower, doth not first sit down, and reckon the charges that are necessary, whether he have wherewithal to finish it:
14:29 Lest, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able ti finish it, all that see it begin to mock him,
14:30 Saying: This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
14:31 Or what king, about to go to make war against another king, doth not first sit down, and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?
14:32 Or else, whilst the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth conditions of peace.
14:33 So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth, cannot be my disciple.
