v. Dieu a manifesté ce qui doit arriver bientôt, parlant par son Ange à son serviteur Jean, lequel témoigne de la parole de Dieu et du témoignage de Jésus-Christ, pour tout ce qu'il a vu.
$Deo gratias

[HymnusM Vespera]
v. Thee, O Christ, the Father's splendour,
Life and virtue of the heart,
In the presence of the Angels
Sing we now with tuneful art,
Meetly in alternate chorus
Bearing our responsive part.
_
Thus we praise with veneration
All the armies of the sky;
Chiefly him, the warrior Primate,
Of celestial chivalry,
Michael, who in princely virtue
Cast Abaddon from on high.
_
By whose watchful care repelling -
King of everlasting grace -
Every ghostly adversary,
All things evil, all things base,
Grant us of thine only goodness
In thy Paradise a place.
_
Laud and honour to the Father,
Laud and honour to the Son,
Laud and honour to the Spirit,
Ever Three, and ever One,
Consubstantial, co-eternal,
While unending ages run.
Amen.

[Hymnus Vespera]
O Vous, splendeur et force du Père, 
Jésus, vie de nos cœurs, 
Nous Vous louons parmi les Anges
Soumis à vos ordres. 
_
C'est pour Vous qu'elle milite, 
Cette couronne nombreuse de mille et mille chefs ; 
Victorieux, Michel, le porte-étendard du salut,
Déploie le drapeau de la Croix.
_
C'est lui qui précipite au fond des enfers 
La tête cruelle du dragon ; 
Le chef avec ses rebelles, 
Il les foudroie du haut de la citadelle céleste.
_
Contre le prince de l'orgueil, 
Suivons notre chef, 
Pour obtenir, du trône de l'Agneau, 
La couronne de gloire.
_
A Dieu le Père soit la gloire ; 
Qu’Il garde par ses Anges 
Ceux que le Fils a rachetés 
Et qu'a oints le Saint-Esprit.
Amen.

Lesson from the book of Daniel
!Dan 7:9-11
9 I beheld till thrones were placed, and the Ancient of days sat: his garment~
was white as snow, and the hair of his head like clean wool: his throne like~
flames of fire: the wheels of it like a burning fire.
10 A swift stream of fire issued forth from before him: thousands of thousands~
ministered to him, and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before him:~
the judgment sat, and the books were opened.
11 I beheld because of the voice of the great words which that horn spoke: and I~
saw that the beast was slain, and the body thereof was destroyed, and given to~
the fire to be burnt:

[Responsory1]
R. There was silence in heaven while the dragon fought against Michael the~
Archangel.
* I heard the voice of thousands of thousands, saying: Salvation, and honour,~
and power unto God the Almighty. (Alleluia.)
V. Thousands of thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times hundreds~
of thousands stood before Him.
R. I heard the voice of thousands of thousands, saying: Salvation, and honour,~
and power unto God, the Almighty. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio2]
!Dan 10:4-8
4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month I was by the great river~
which is the Tigris.
5 And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw: and behold a man clothed in linen, and his~
loins were girded with the finest gold:
6 And his body was like the chrysolite, and his face as the appearance of~
lightning, and his eyes as a burning lamp: and his arms, and all downward even~
to the feet, like in appearance to glittering brass: and the voice of his word~
like the voice of a multitude.
7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw it not:~
but an exceeding great terror fell upon them, and they fled away, and hid~
themselves.
8 And I being left alone saw this great vision: and there remained no strength~
in me, and the appearance of my countenance was changed in me, and I fainted~
away, and retained no strength.

[Responsory2]
R. An Angel stood at the Altar of the temple, having a golden censer in his hand~
and there was given unto him much incense;
* And the smoke of the incense ascended up before the Lord, out of the Angel's~
hand. (Alleluia.)
V. Before the Angels will I sing praise unto thee; I will worship toward thy~
holy temple, and praise thy Name, O Lord.
R. And the smoke of the incense ascended up before the Lord, out of the Angel's~
hand. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio3]
!Dan 10:9-14
9 And I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard, I lay in a consternation,~
upon my face, and my face was close to the ground.
10 And behold a hand touched me, and lifted me up upon my knees, and upon the~
joints of my hands.
11 And he said to me: Daniel, thou man of desires, understand the words that I~
speak to thee, and stand upright: for I am sent now to thee. And when he had~
said this word to me, I stood trembling.
12 And he said to me: Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst~
set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the sight of thy God, thy~
words have been heard: and I am come for thy words.
13 But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one and twenty~
days: and behold Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I~
remained there by the king of the Persians.
14 But I am come to teach thee what things shall befall thy people in the latter~
days, for as yet the vision is for days.

[Responsory3]
R. Before the Angels will I sing praise unto thee, and will worship toward thy~
holy temple
* And I will praise thy Name, O Lord. (Alleluia.)
V. For thy loving kindness, and for thy truth; for Thou hast glorified thine~
holy Name on us.
R. And I will praise thy Name, O Lord. (Alleluia.)
&Gloria
R. And I will praise thy Name, O Lord. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio4]
That the blessed Archangel Michael hath oftentimes been seen of men is attested~
on the authority of the Holy Bible, and also by the ancient traditions of the~
Saints. For this reason such visions are held in remembrance in many places. As~
of old time did the Synagogue of the Jews, so now doth the Church of God~
venerate Michael as her watcher and defender. But during the papacy of Gelasius~
I. the summit of Mount Gargano in Apulia, at whose foot lieth the town of~
Siponto, was the scene of an extraordinary appearance of this same Archangel~
Michael.

[Responsory4]
R. This is Michael, who to battle leads the armies of the skies
* Whosoever on him calleth blessed within his wardship lies. His a prayer whose~
voice availing aids from earth toward heaven to rise. (Alleluia.)
V. The Archangel Michael is the Vice-Roy of Paradise, and the Angels that are~
the dwellers therein, do hold him in worship.
R. Whosoever on him calleth blessed within his wardship lies. His a prayer whose~
voice availing aids from earth toward heaven to rise. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio5]
And it came to pass on this wise. A certain man had a bull grazing with the~
flock upon Mount Gargano, and it strayed. And when they had sought it for a long~
while they found it jammed in the mouth of a cavern. Then one that stood there~
shot an arrow at it to slay it, but the arrow turned round and came back against~
him that had shot it. They therefore that saw it, and all those that heard it,~
were sore afraid because of that which had come to pass, so that no man dared~
any more to draw near to the cavern. But when they had sought counsel of the~
Bishop of Siponto, he answered, that it behoved to seek the interpretation from~
God, and proclaimed three days of fasting and prayer.

[Responsory5]
R. Where Angels lead the spirits of the blessed dead the glad procession moves~
with Michael at its head
* To lead them into the garden of Eden. (Alleluia.)
V. Lord, send thy Holy Spirit from heaven the Spirit of wisdom and~
understanding.
R. To lead them into the garden of Eden. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio6]
After three days the Archangel Michael gave warning to the Bishop that that~
place was under his protection, and that he had thus pointed out by a sign that~
he wished that worship should be offered to God there, with remembrance of~
himself and of the Angels. Then the Bishop and the citizens made haste and came to the cavern and when they~
found that the form thereof was somewhat after the fashion of a Church, they~
began to perform the public worship of God therein which sanctuary hath been~
glorified with many miracles. It was not long after these things that Pope~
Boniface IV. hallowed the Church of St. Michael on Hadrian's Mole at Rome, on the~
29th day of September, on the which day the Church also holdeth in remembrance~
All Angels. But this present day is hallowed in remembrance of the manifestation~
of the Archangel Michael.

[Responsory6]
R. At that time shall Michael stand up, which standeth for your children.
* And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to~
that same time. (Alleluia.)
V. At that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found~
written in the Book of Life.
R. And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to~
that same time. (Alleluia.)
&Gloria
R. And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to~
that same time. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-10
At that time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying: Who is the greatest in~
the kingdom of heaven? And so on.
_
Homily by St. Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers.
!Com. on Matth. xviii.
Unless ye become as little children," saith the Lord, "ye shall not enter into~
the kingdom of heaven," that is, unless by the uprooting of bodily and mental~
depravity, we bring our souls to the innocency of childhood. But He giveth the~
name of children to all such as believe by the hearing of faith. Children follow~
their father, love their mother, know not how to wish evil to their neighbours,~
are not careful for earthly riches they insult not, they hate not, they lie~
not, they believe what they are told, and take for truth what they hear. Us then~
it behoveth to return to the simpleness of little children, for when we are well~
rooted therein, we shall so far bear about in ourselves an image of the sublime~
simpleness of the Lord Jesus.

[Responsory7]
R. Be not ye afraid before the Gentiles, but in your hearts, worship ye the~
Lord, and fear Him
* For His Angel is with you. (Alleluia.)
V. An Angel stood at the Altar of the Temple, having a golden censer in his~
hand.
R. For His Angel is with you. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio8]
Woe unto the world because of offences. The lowliness of the Passion is an~
offence unto the world. Such is the state of stupidity to which man's ignorance~
hath reduced itself, that it turneth away from the Lord of Eternal Glory,~
because of the unsightliness of the Cross. And what is so certain to bring woe~
unto the world as to turn away from Christ. And therefore He saith: "It must~
needs be that offences come," because His fulfilling the lowliness of the~
Passion was the predestined mean whereby He was to give us eternal life.

[Responsory8]
R. The Archangel Michael came to help God's people.
* He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluia.)
V. An Angel stood at the Altar of the Temple, having a golden censer in his~
hand.
R. He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluia.)
&Gloria
R. He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio9]
Make heed that ye despise not one of these little ones that believe in Me." He~
hath laid on us a most meet tie to constrain us to love one another, especially~
such as indeed believe in the Lord. "For I say unto you that in heaven their~
Angels do always behold the face of My Father Which is in heaven. For the Son of~
Man is come to save that which was lost." From these words we see, first, that~
the Son of Man saveth secondly, that the Angels do see God and thirdly, that~
the Angels of these little ones have the wardship over the prayers of the~
faithful. That the Angels have this wardship is taught us absolutely. The Angels~
therefore do every day offer to God the prayers which they which are saved do~
make to Him in the Name of Christ. Therefore it is dangerous for a man to~
despise them, seeing that these are they by whose watchful service and ministry,~
his wishes and requests are presented before the throne of the eternal and~
unseen God.
