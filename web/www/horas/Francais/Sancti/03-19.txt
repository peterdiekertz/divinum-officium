[Ant Vespera]
Or Jacob engendra Joseph, * l’époux de Marie, de laquelle est né Jésus, qui est appelé Christ.;;109
L’ange Gabriel * fut envoyé par Dieu à un homme du nom de Joseph, de la maison de David, et le nom de la Vierge était Marie.;;110
Alors qu’elle * était fiancée à Joseph et avant qu’ils s’unissent, Marie, la Mère de Jésus, se trouva avoir conçu du Saint-Esprit.;;111
Joseph, son époux, * qui était un homme juste et ne voulait pas la diffamer, résolut de la renvoyer secrètement.;;112
Un ange du Seigneur apparut à Joseph, * disant : Joseph, fils de David, ne crains pas de prendre avec toi Marie ton épouse car ce qui est né en elle est du Saint-Esprit. Elle enfantera un fils et tu l’appelleras du nom de Jésus.;;116

[Capitulum Vespera]
!Prov 28:20; 27:18
v. L’homme fidèle sera beaucoup loué. Et celui qui est le gardien de son Seigneur sera glorifié.
$Deo gratias

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Que les anges du ciel te célèbrent, Joseph,
que le chœur des chrétiens tous ensemble t'acclame :
ton mérite éclatant te valut d'être uni
par une chaste alliance à la Vierge de gloire.
_
Quand ton épouse enceinte des œuvres de Dieu
trouble ton cœur anxieux et touché par le doute,
un ange te l'apprend : l'enfant qu'elle a conçu
vient de l'Esprit d'En-haut qui a soufflé sur elle.
_
Le Seigneur né, tu Le serres dans tes bras ;
Avec Lui tu fuis au lointain pays d’Egypte ;
Perdu à Jérusalem, tu Le cherches, tu Le trouves,
Tes larmes coulent de joie.
_
Les autres, c’est après leur mort qu’un sort heureux les consacre,
Que la palme de la gloire récompense leurs mérites ;
Toi, ton sort est plus heureux : c’est vivant, égal à ceux d’En-haut,
Que Dieu présent fait ta joie.
_
Trinité souveraine, exauce nos prières :
Par les mérites de Joseph accorde-nous de monter au ciel,
Afin qu’il nous soit permis de Te chanter à jamais
Une hymne de gratitude.
Amen.

[Versum 1]
V. Il l’a établi seigneur de Sa maison. Alleluia.
R. Et maître de tout Son domaine. Alleluia.

[Ant 1]
Se levant de son sommeil, Joseph fit ce que lui avait prescrit l’ange du Seigneur et prit avec lui son épouse.

[Oratio]
Faites, Seigneur, s’il Vous plaît, que nous soyons secourus par les mérites de l’époux de Votre très sainte Mère afin que ce que nous ne pouvons obtenir de nous-mêmes nous soit donné par son intercession.
$Qui vivis

[Invit]
O come, let us worship * Christ the Son of God, Who vouchsafed to be supposed the son of Joseph.

[Hymnus Matutinum]
v. Joseph, the praise and glory of the heavens,
Sure pledge of life, and safety of the wide world,
As in our joy we sing to thee, in kindness
List to our praises.
_
Thou by the world's Creator wert appointed
Spouse of the Virgin: thee he willed to honour
Naming thee father of the Word, and guardian
Of our salvation.
_
Thou thy Redeemer, lying in a stable,
Whom long ago foretold the choir of prophets,
Sawest rejoicing, and thy God adoredst
Humble in childhood.
_
God, King of kings, and Governor of the ages,
He at whose word the powers of hell do tremble,
He whom the adoring heavens ever worship
Called the protector.
_
Grant us, great Trinity, for Joseph's holy sake,
In highest bliss and love, above the stars to reign,
That we in joy with him may praise our loving God,
And sing our glad eternal strain.
Amen.

[Ant Matutinum]

[Lectio1]
Lesson from the book of Genesis
!Gen 39:1-5
1 And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar an eunuch of Pharao, chief~
captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was~
brought.
2 And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he~
dwelt in his master's house,
3 Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to~
prosper in his hand.
4 And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and~
being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all~
things that were delivered to him:
5 And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake.

[Responsory1]
R. The Lord was with Joseph, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of~
the prison.
* And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that~
were in the prison.
V. And whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it because the Lord was~
with him, and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper.
R. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners~
that were in the prison.

[Lectio2]
!Gen 41:37-40
37 The counsel pleased Pharao and all his servants.
38 And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit~
of God?
39 He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast~
said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?
40 Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the~
people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.

[Responsory2]
R. When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to the king for~
bread. And the king said unto all the Egyptians:
* Go unto Joseph; and what he saith to you, do.
V. The famine was more grievous every day over all the face of the earth, and~
Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians.
R. Go unto Joseph; and what he saith to you, do.

[Lectio3]
!Gen 41:41-44
41 And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole~
land of Egypt.
42 And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put~
upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.
43 And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all~
should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made govenor~
over the whole land of Egypt.
44 And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao; without thy commandment no man~
shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord hath made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house~
fear not
* For God sent me before you into Egypt, to save your lives.
V. Come unto me, and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, and ye shall~
eat the fat of the land.
R. For God sent me before you into Egypt, to save your lives.
&Gloria
R. For God sent me before you into Egypt, to save your lives.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux.
!2nd on Luke i. 26
What and what manner of man the blessed Joseph was, we may gather from that~
title wherewith, albeit only as a deputy, God deemed him fit to be honoured he~
was both called, and supposed to be the Father of God. We may gather it from his~
very name, which, being interpreted, signifieth Increase. Remember likewise that~
great Patriarch who was sold into Egypt, and know that the Husband of Mary not~
only received his name, but inherited his purity, and was likened to him in~
innocence and in grace.

[Responsory4]
R. Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto~
the city of David, which is called Bethlehem
* Because he was of the house and lineage of David.
V. To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife.
R. Because he was of the house and lineage of David.

[Lectio5]
If then, that Joseph that was sold by his brethren through envy, and was~
brought down to Egypt, was a type of Christ sold by a disciple, and handed over~
to the Gentiles, the other Joseph flying from the envy of Herod carried Christ~
into Egypt. That first Joseph kept loyal to his master, and would not carnally~
know his master's wife; that second Joseph knew that the Lady, the Mother of his~
Lord, was a virgin, and he himself remained faithfully virgin toward her. To~
that first Joseph it was given to know dark things in interpreting of dreams; to~
the second Joseph it was given in sleep to know the mysteries of the kingdom of~
heaven.

[Responsory5]
R. Arise, and take the young Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt;
* And be thou there until I bring thee word.
V. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet,~
saying Out of Egypt have I called My Son.
R. And be thou there until I bring thee word.

[Lectio6]
The first Joseph laid by bread, not for himself, but for all people; the second~
Joseph received into his keeping that Living Bread Which came down from heaven,~
not for him only, but for the whole world. We cannot doubt but that that Joseph~
was good and faithful to whom was espoused the Mother of the Saviour. Yea, I say,~
he was a faithful and wise servant, whom the Lord appointed to be the comfort of~
His own Mother, the keeper of His own Body, and the only and trusty helper in~
the Eternal Counsels.

[Responsory6]
R. When His parents brought the Child Jesus into the temple, to do for Him after~
the custom of the law,
* Simeon took Him up in his arms, and blessed God.
V. And His father and mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of Him.
R. Simeon took Him up in his arms, and blessed God.
&Gloria
R. Simeon took Him up in his arms, and blessed God.

[Responsory7]
R. The Mother of Jesus said unto Him Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us?
* Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
V. And He said unto them: How is it that ye sought Me? Wist ye not that I must~
be about My Father's business?
R. Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

[Responsory8]
R. Jesus went down with them, and came to Nazareth
* And was subject unto them.
V. He increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
R. And was subject unto them.
&Gloria
R. And was subject unto them.

Les parents de Jésus * allaient tous les ans à Jérusalem au jour solennel de la Pâques.
Tandis qu’ils revenaient, * l’enfant Jésus demeura à Jérusalem et Ses parents ne s’en aperçurent point.

v. Celui dont nous, fidèles, célébrons la gloire ; 
celui dont nous chantons le glorieux triomphe, 
Joseph est entré aujourd'hui 
dans les délices de l'éternelle vie.

 Mortel heureux, trois fois heureux,

autour de sa couche, le Christ et la Vierge 
l'assister d'un visage serein.

et son front est ceint d'un diadème éclatant.
_
Maintenant qu'il règne, supplions-le tous 
de nous être propice ; qu'il obtienne 
le pardon de nos fautes et nous procure 
la paix avec le ciel.

pour jamais sur le front du serviteur fidèle.
