Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 15:1-7
 Én vagyok az igazi szőlőtő, s Atyám a szőlőműves. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Tract 80, on John.
Dearly beloved brethren, this passage of the Gospel, wherein the Lord saith that~
He is the vine, and that His disciples are the branches, is to be taken in that~
sense wherein it is also said, that He is the Head of the Church, (Eph. v. 23,)~
and that we are the members of Him (30) Who is the Mediator between God and men,~
the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. ii. 5.) The vine and his branches are of one and~
the same nature. Therefore, seeing that He was God, of which nature we are not,~
He was made man, to the end that He might have in Himself this vine, that is,~
the manhood, whereof we men can be made branches.
